    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>450g milk chocolate, broken into pieces</li>
        <li>150g ginger nut biscuits, broken into 1cm chunks</li>
        <li>100g mini marshmellows</li>
        <li>2 40g Crunchie bars, cut into 1cm chunks</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Line the base and sides of a 20cm square cake tin, with baking parchment.</li>
        <li>Place the milk chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of hot water. Bring the water to boil, then take the pan off the
            heat and allow the chocolate to melt slowly. Once the chocolate has melted, remove the bowl from the saucepan and allow the chocolate
            to cool to just above room temperature. (If it is too hotm the marshmellows will melt.)

        </li>
        <li>Stir in the remaining ingredients and press into the prepared tin. Place in the fridge to chill for 1-2 hours or
            until set, then cut into fingers or squares to serve. Enjoy!
