        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Marinate chicken with chilli powder, salt, turmeric, pepper and garam masala.
                Keep aside until you prepare the rest.
            </li>
            <li>Heat 1 1/2 tablespoon coconut oil in a pan. Add onions and fry until they turn golden.</li>
            <li>Add ginger garlic paste and fry until the raw smell goes away, for 1 to 2 mins.</li>
            <li>Transfer the marinated chicken and fry on a slightly high flame until it turns white in color, for about 3 to 4 mins</li>
            <li>Then add the ground spice mixture and mix well. Cover and cook on a low flame until the chicken is slightly tender.
                Keep stirring in between for even cooking.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Optional</strong> - If using tomatoes, then add at this stage and saute further until tomatoes lose the raw flavour.</li>
            <li>If the pan is too dry, pour 1/4 cup hot water. This depends on how much moisture your chicken releases.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is tender, pour the coconut milk. Mix well. If using canned coconut milk, shake it well and then use.</li>
            <li>When the coconut milk begins to bubble cover and simmer for 5 mins. Taste test and add more salt.s</li>
        </ol>
