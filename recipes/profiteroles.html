    <h1>Profiteroles</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>50g butter (preferably unsalted), cut into cubes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>75g strong white flour, sifted with a pinch of fine sea salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>300ml double cream</li>
        <li>A few drops vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the sauce</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>50g cocoa powder</li>
        <li>175g caster sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/gas 7. To make the profiteroles, put the butter
            and 2 tsp of the caster sugar in a saucepan with 150ml water. Place the pan over a low heat
            until the butter and sugar have melted, then bring to the boil. Take off the heat, add
            the flour all at once and beat energetically with a wooden spoon until the dough comes 
            away from the sides of the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Leave to cool for 5 mins, then beat in the eggs bit by bit until you have a stiff, glossy mixture
            (this process is much easier in a food processor). Rinse two baking trays with cold water, shaking off
            any excess so they are slightly damp (this helps the pastry to rise). Using 2 teaspoons, spoon
            blobs of the mixture onto the baking trays. Then place in the oven and cook for about 18-20 mins
            until well risen and brown. Remove the profiteroles from the oven and cut a small slit in the base of each one 
            so they don't collapse. Cool on a wire rack.

        </li>
        <li>When they're cold, whip the cream lightly until just holding shape. Sweeten to taste with remaining sugar
            and a few drops of vanilla extract. Cut the profiteroles in half, fill them with the sweetened cream and pile 
            them up on a plate. You can refrigerate them for 1-2 hrs at this point but not for any longer as the pastry will go soggy.

            To make the sauce, sift the cocoa powder into a bowl. Put the sugar in a pan with 100ml water and warm over a low heat 
            until dissolved. Bring to the boil, cook for 1 min, then pour over the cocoa powder and stir well until smooth. Return
            the sauce to the pan, cook for 1 min then set aside for 15 mins before drizzling over the profiteroles.
